Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target system (e.g., IPs, open ports).

Tool: Nmap (for scanning networks).
Exploitation: Finding and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access.

Tool: Metasploit (for launching exploits).
Privilege Escalation: Elevating access from normal user to admin/root.

Tool: Mimikatz (for password extraction).
Lateral Movement: Moving within the network from one system to another.

Tool: PsExec (for executing commands on remote systems).
Data Exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data.

Monitoring: Keeping track of network activity and system logs to detect anomalies.

Tool: SIEM (e.g., Splunk or ELK Stack).

Detection: Identifying potential threats like unauthorized access or malware.

Tool: IDS/IPS (e.g., Snort or Suricata).
Response: Taking action to stop or contain the attack (e.g., blocking access, isolating infected systems).

Tool: Firewall (to block malicious traffic).
Forensics: Investigating an attack to understand how it happened and what was affected.

Tool: Volatility (for memory analysis) or The Sleuth Kit (for disk forensics).
Patch Management: Regularly updating systems to fix vulnerabilities.

Tool: OpenVAS (for vulnerability scanning).
